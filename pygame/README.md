Pygame adaptation of Warhammer 40k tabletop game.

The white circles on the left of the screen are selectable tabletop "models".
The white circles on the right are non-selectable "target models".
The large yellow circle that appears on model selection shows remaining move distance. The red one shows the model's shooting range.

Controls:
LMB on a model (circle) to select it. A model will turn green to indicate that it is selected.
RMB on selected model to activate move mode. Model then follows the mouse, subtracting move points as it is moved. A model will turn yellow to show that it is in "move mode".
Spacebar while a model is selected (but not in move mode) will reset it to its original position.
Middle click while a model is selected will delete a target model if that model is in range.
