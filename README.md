Pygame adaptation of the 8th Edition of the Warhammer 40k tabletop game.

Both python and pygame are required to run this program. Python 2.7 or newer is recommended.
To install python, visit https://www.python.org/downloads/.
To install pygame, use this pip install command in the command line:
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

Note: "python3" might be "python" or "py" instead depending on your version of python.

Once both are installed, download this entire folder.
Change directory to the pygame folder and run main.py.
